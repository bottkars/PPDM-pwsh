# Modifying Preferred Address for a Host
We can Modify the Preferred Communication Method for App Agents Hosts.
Adreesses can be IPV4, IPV6 and FQDN

## Modify an AppHost

In this example we Modify the Address of the AppHost *sqlsinglenode.dpslab.home.labbuildr.com*
First, we read the AppHost Information
```Powershell
$AppHostName="sqlsinglenode.dpslab.home.labbuildr.com"
$AppHost=Get-PPDMhosts -type APP_HOST -filter "{name eq `"$AppHostName`"}"
$AppHost
```

Now that we have the AppHost, lets view the Valid Addresses available:
```Powershell
$AppHost | Get-PPDMhosts -validaddresses
```

The AppHost uses its IPV4 Address to communicate. Kest Change that to the FQDN:

```Powershell
$AppHost | Set-ppDMapp_hosts -type FQDN -value sqlsinglenode.dpslab.home.labbuildr.com
AppHost | Get-PPDMhosts -validaddresses
```
